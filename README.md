# password-generator

# User Story 
The purpose of this project was to create a random password generator that allows you to pick between 8 and 128 characters. It also allows you to select the type of charcaters you want in the password, including numbers, uppercase, lowercase and special. 

# Acceptance Criteria
The acceptance criteria for the generator is as follows;
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

# Fulfilling the Criteria
I believe that I have met all required criteria for this homework assignment. 
The password generator spits out a number that meets the parameters set out by the prompts, when first clicking the "Generate Password" Button. If the user does not click a certain prompt, then the page will not display the undesirable character type. 
Additionally, javascript will actually re-prompt you to enter in a password length between the required parameters if you failed to do so.

# Review
This was pretty much the hardest homework assignment I have ever done in my life. I worked well over 40 hours on this assingment and just barely got it to function properly. The things I struggled with the most we're random number generation and the creation of sub-arrays.

# Summary
This project taught me the importance of pseudocoding and structured thinking. Without a roadmap to your destination, you're basically just driving around aimlessly.
